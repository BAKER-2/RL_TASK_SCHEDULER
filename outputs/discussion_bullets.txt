DISCUSSION BULLETS (AUTO-GENERATED FROM RESULTS)

Overall observations:

- For Average waiting time, the most frequent best-performing scheduler across workloads was SJF (wins in 4/4 workloads).
- For Deadline miss rate, the most frequent best-performing scheduler across workloads was SJF (wins in 4/4 workloads).
- For Throughput, the most frequent best-performing scheduler across workloads was FCFS (wins in 4/4 workloads).

Key interpretation points (report-ready):

- SJF often achieves the best average waiting time in this simulator because task processing times are known exactly, and SJF is well-known to be near-optimal for minimizing mean waiting time under such assumptions.
- The RL-based scheduler (DQN) optimizes cumulative reward rather than directly minimizing average waiting time; therefore, matching (rather than surpassing) SJF is expected unless the reward is explicitly aligned with SJF’s objective.
- EDF typically performs strongly on deadline miss rate in deadline-constrained workloads because it prioritizes tasks with the earliest deadlines, which directly targets the miss-rate objective.
- The RL scheduler’s comparable performance to classical baselines indicates that it learned stable scheduling behavior without relying on fixed hand-crafted rules.
- Mixed results across workloads are scientifically valid and support the study’s aim: understanding when learning-based scheduling can approximate or complement traditional heuristics.
